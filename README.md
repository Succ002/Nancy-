Skin is one of the largest organs of the body. Because of this, caring for your skin can directly affect your overall health. Your skin acts as a protective shield and is most vulnerable to outside elements. It’s affected by more factors than you may think. For instance, the following can play a role in your overall skin health:

exposure to UV radiation in tanning beds
exposure to chemical toxins in tobacco
unprotected sun exposure for long periods of time
not getting enough rest, fluids, or nutrition
aging
Taking care of your skin
There are steps you can take to ensure you have healthy skin. They include the following:

Cleanse regularly, typically twice daily.
Apply a toner after cleansing if you have oily skin.
Apply a moisturizer if you have dry skin.
Exfoliate to remove dead skin cells and brighten up your complexion.
Besides a daily skin care routine, make it a habit to examine your own skin for abnormalities, discolorations, or any other changes on a regular basis. Have your skin examined by a doctor or dermatologist annually for any changes, or if:

you have fair skin or many or large moles
you are in the sun or use tanning beds
you have a history of skin problems, irritations, or growths
It’s also important to protect your skin from too much sun and sun damage, which may increase wrinkles as well as lead to skin cancer. Cover your skin or use sunscreen to protect your skin from the damaging rays of the sun. See your doctor or dermatologist if any skin irritations or problems arise.

Understanding skin care products
There are many products out there that are presented as a surefire way to turn back the clock, permanently melt away cellulite, reduce wrinkles, and more. Pay attention and do your research to decide whether a product is really necessary for the health of your skin or if it’s potentially harmful. Ask your doctor for advice, too.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDATrusted Source) regulates many products. It must regulate products that change a person’s physical structure or biochemical processes within the body.

Products that are classified as cosmetics or dietary supplements are not regulated. Examples of these include:

moisturizers
hair coloring
toothpaste
deodorant
vitamins
herbals
enzymes
